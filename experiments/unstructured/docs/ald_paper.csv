4caa28f42ec66b346172e2e3db7824b0,"Chronic liver disease due to alcohol-use disorder contributes markedly to the global burden of disease and mortality1–3. Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe and life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver disease. The gut microbiota promotes ethanol- induced liver disease in mice4, but little is known about the microbial factors that are responsible for this process. Here we identify cytolysin—a two-subunit exotoxin that is secreted by Enterococcus faecalis5,6—as a cause of hepatocyte death and liver injury. Compared with non-alcoholic individuals or patients with alcohol-use disorder, patients with alcoholic hepatitis have increased faecal numbers of E. faecalis. The presence of cytolysin-positive (cytolytic) E. faecalis correlated with the severity of liver disease and with mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Using humanized mice that were colonized with bacteria from the faeces of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, we investigated the therapeutic effects of

Therapy with corticosteroids is only marginally effective9. Early liver transplantation is the only curative therapy, but is offered only at select centres and to a limited group of patients10.

Alcohol-related liver disease can be transmitted via faecal micro- biota4. We investigated the microorganisms and microbial factors that are responsible for this transmissible phenotype and for progression of alcohol-related liver disease.

Cytolysin is a bacterial exotoxin (or bacteriocin) that is produced by E. faecalis12, and which contains two post-translationally modified peptides (CylLL′′ and CylLS′′) in its bioactive form6. The two peptides are encoded by two separate genes: cylLL and cylLS, respec- tively12. Cytolysin has lytic activity against not only Gram-positive bacte- ria, but also eukaryotic cells13. We detected cylLL and cylLS genomic DNA (cytolysin-positive) in faecal samples from 30% of patients with alco- holic hepatitis; none of the faecal samples from controls and only one sample from a patient with alcohol-use disorder was cytolysin-positive, as detected by qPCR (Fig. 1b).

When we performed receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis for 90-day mortality, cytolysin had an area under the curve of 0.81, which was superior to other widely used predictors for mortality in clinical practice (Extended Data Fig. 1e). On the basis of our findings, we propose that the detection of cytolysin may be a prognostic factor for more severe liver- related outcomes and increased risk of death, and a stronger predictor of mortality than MELD, ABIC and the discriminant function score.

Whole- genome sequencing of 93 E. faecalis isolates revealed a broad phylo- genetic diversity of cytolysin-positive E. faecalis from patients with alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 1d), which indicates that cytolysin production is a variable trait among E. faecalis isolates and that cytolysin is car- ried in mobile genetic elements, which include both chromosomally encoded pathogenicity islands and plasmids14. Detection of any other antimicrobial resistance genes or virulence genes in E. faecalis isolates did not correlate with disease severity or mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (Supplementary Table 4).

Incubation of the primary mouse hepatocytes with the two cytolysin subunits caused a dose-dependent increase in cell death compared to hepatocytes that were incubated with vehicle or with one subunit only (Fig. 2h). When we isolated hepatocytes from ethanol-fed mice and then incubated these hepatocytes with ethanol, we did not observe increased levels of cytolysin-induced cell death compared to hepatocytes isolated from mice on the control diet, which indicates that cytolysin-induced hepatocyte cell death was independent of ethanol. The cytotoxic effects of cytolysin are possibly mediated by pore forma- tion, resulting in cell lysis14.

ffd24ef49d7f085e864bbc10c1a1ba0f,"Discussion Phage-based therapies have predominantly been studied in patients with bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal tract21–23, urinary tract24,25 and other organ systems26–28. The results of these studies— although mixed in terms of efficacy—strongly suggest that phage treat- ment offers a safe alternative to antibiotics26,27. However, safety studies are required for complex populations (such as patients with alcoholic hepatitis), because phages can induce a strong immune reaction29. Further work is required to determine whether phages that target cyto- lytic E. faecalis might be used to treat patients with alcoholic hepatitis, a life-threatening disease that at present has no effective treatment. Eradication of this specific bacterial strain might produce better out- comes than current treatments, and environmental sources can be used to easily isolate phages that target cytolysin-positive E. faecalis. Here we provide an example of the efficacy of approaches based on

Mice were fed with Lieber–DeCarli diet and the caloric intake from ethanol was 0% on days 1–5 and 36% from day 6 until the end of the study period. At day 16, mice were gavaged with a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) in the early morning and killed 9 h later.

and annotated using the previously described pipeline52. Antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes including cytolysin (cyl) genes carried by E. faecalis isolates were identified by comparing individual genome assemblies against the CARD and VFDB databases, respectively, using abricate v0.8.10 (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate)53,54.

For the phylogeny of E. faecalis, the genome assemblies of the study isolates were annotated with Prokka55, and a pangenome estimated using Roary52. A 95% identity cutoff was used, and core genes were defined as those in 99% of isolates. A maximum likelihood tree of the SNPs in the core genes was created using RAxML56 and 100 bootstraps. The resulting tree was visualized using iTOL45. Genome sequence data of E. faecalis strains isolated in this study have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under the accession number PRJEB25007. Sequence reads are available at ENA under run acces- sion identifiers ERR3200171–ERR3200263.

Levels of serum lipopolysac- charide and faecal albumin were determined by enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent kits (Lifeome Biolabs and Bethyl Labs, respectively). Serum levels of ethanol were measured using ethanol assay kit (BioVision).

Staining procedures Formalin-fixed tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and stained with H & E. To determine lipid accumulation, liver sections were embed- ded in OCT compound. Eight-micrometre frozen sections were then cut and stained with Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich). Representative images from each group of mice are shown in each figure. The terminal deoxynucleo- tide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich). We randomly selected five high-power fields for counting TUNEL-positive cells and normalized numbers to total cells.
