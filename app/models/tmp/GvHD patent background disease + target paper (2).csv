NarrativeText,aa8eb4ded24210abd8dffbcab0b52f61,"Disruption of intestinal microbial communities appears to underlie many human illnesses, but the mechanisms that promote this dysbiosis and its adverse consequences are poorly understood. In patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), we describe a high incidence of enterococcal expansion, which was associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and mortality. We found that Enterococcus also expands in the mouse gastrointestinal tract after allo-HCT and exacerbates disease severity in gnotobiotic models. Enterococcus growth is dependent on the disaccharide lactose, and dietary lactose depletion attenuates Enterococcus outgrowth and reduces the severity of GVHD in mice. Allo-HCT patients carrying lactose-nonabsorber genotypes showed compromised clearance of postantibiotic Enterococcus domination. We report lactose as a common nutrient that drives expansion of a commensal bacterium that exacerbates an intestinal and systemic inflammatory disease.",1,GvHD patent background disease + target paper (2).pdf,5

Enterococci are facultative anaerobes that colonize the intes- tines of almost every species, from insects to mammals (2), and make up a very small proportion (<0.1%) of the gut microbiota in healthy humans (3). However, enterococci are also pathogens; the species Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis are impor- tant causes of multidrug-resistant infections in patients (4). In single-center studies, E. faecium has been observed to dominate the fecal microbiota of immunocompromised patients after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), a curative-intent therapy for hematological malignancies (5–7). Moreover, fecal domination with vancomycin- resistant enterococci increases the risk of",1,GvHD patent background disease + target paper (2).pdf,6

Patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allo-HCT have poor outcomes with only ~30% long-term survival (9). Gut microbiota perturbations caused by broad-spectrum antibiotics and a reduction in microbial diversity are associated with in- creased transplant-related mortality and lethal GVHD in humans and mice (10–13). Besides causing infections, experimental studies in gno- tobiotic mice have revealed that enterococci play an important role in colitis (14) by stimulat- ing antigen-presenting cells and CD4+RORg+ T cell infiltration, causing intestinal inflam- mation (15). In this study, we investigated the role of enterococci in the development of acute GVHD, both in allo-HCT patients and preclinical allo-HCT mouse models.",1,GvHD patent background disease + target paper (2).pdf,7

Pre- and posttransplant fecal samples from MSKCC patients who received allo-HCT for acute myeloid leukemia were selected for sequencing on the basis of having a highly diverse pre-HCT microbiota and posttrans- plant E. faecium domination (by 16S rRNA gene sequencing). We focused on microbial metabolic pathways that specifically charac- terize domination by comparing them with the highly diverse pretransplant microbiota from the same patients. Pathways involved in DNA synthesis and, notably, in lactose and galactose degradation were enriched in the E. faecium–dominated, posttransplant micro- biota. In contrast, amino acid synthesis and starch-degradation pathways were more prev- alent in pretransplant specimens (Fig. 3A).

Comparison of whole-genome sequencing from isolates of E. faecium (from a human allo-HCT patient) and of E. faecalis (from a mouse with GVHD) revealed that genes encoding lactose and galactose metabolism accounted for ~3% of their genomes (Fig. 3C).

This may be important for allo-HCT patients, as high abundances of clostridia are associated with better survival and low- er incidence of GVHD (12, 25). Commen- sal clostridia are known to produce large amounts of butyrate (26), which mitigates lethal GVHD in mice through protecting energy homeostasis of enterocytes (27). We observed that posttransplant enterococcal domination and a loss of clostridia were accompanied by a significant reduction in fecal butyrate in both allo-HCT patients and mice with GVHD (Fig. 3, E and G) (28).

Our findings extend previous reports from smaller single-center analyses that posttransplant VRE bacteremia and fecal domination are associated with worse outcomes after allo-HCT (7, 8, 30). In gnotobiotic mouse models, enterococci exacerbate GVHD, consistent with previous reports of aggravated colitis in models of in- flammatory bowel disease (14) or systemic autoimmune responses (31). We previously identified Blautia abundance (a genus within class Clostridia) as a predictor of protection from lethal GVHD (12), whereas here we describe Enterococcus domination as a risk factor for GVHD. These two findings are noteworthy in light of our recent observa- tion that a B. producta strain can inhibit VRE growth via the production of a lantibiotic pro- tein (32). We identified a microbiota-intrinsic mechanism that is dependent on lactose uti- lization and favors the expansion of enterococci. This process may be triggered through a loss of lactase produced by enterocytes damaged by conditioning or allo-reactive T cells. We validated this concept experimentally, by showing that depletion of lactose in vitro and in vivo inhibited enterococcal expan- sion and mitigated GVHD, and clinically, by showing that patients harboring a lactose- malabsorption allele experienced prolonged Enterococcus domination after antibiotic ex- posure. These observations in mice and allo- HCT patients provide proof-of-concept for a novel, non–antibiotic-based therapeutic strategy, such as a lactose-free diet, to attenu- ate the outgrowth of pathobionts like enter- ococci and possibly improve clinical outcomes by modulating dietary sources of nutrients for",6,GvHD patent background disease + target paper (2).pdf,184

NarrativeText,53d649edc73d0883787886c7e4b43696,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is used to treat certain hematopoietic malignancies, but patients have a risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Stein-Thoeringer et al. performed a large-scale analysis of more than 1300 patients treated with allo-HCT across four clinical centers (see the Perspective by Zitvogel and Kroemer). High levels of bacteria from the Enterococcus genus were associated with greater incidence of GVHD and mortality. Lactose appears to provide a substrate for Enterococcus growth, and patients with a lactose-malabsorption genotype had a greater abundance of Enterococcus. A lactose-free diet limited Enterococcus growth, reduced the severity of GVHD, and improved survival in gnotobiotic mouse models.",8,GvHD patent background disease + target paper (2).pdf,245
