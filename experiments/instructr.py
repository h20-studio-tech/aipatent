bloodstream infection in allo-HCT patients (5, 8). Patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allo-HCT have poor outcomes 
with only ~30% long-term survival (9). Gut microbiota perturbations caused by broad-spectrum antibiotics and a reduction 
in microbial diversity are associated with in- creased transplant-related mortality and lethal GVHD in humans and mice (10â€“13). 
Besides causing infections, experimental studies in gno- tobiotic mice have revealed that enterococci play an important role in 
colitis (14) by stimulat- ing antigen-presenting cells and CD4+RORg+ T cell infiltration, causing intestinal inflam- mation (15). 
In this study, we investigated the role of enterococci in the development of acute GVHD, both in allo-HCT patients and preclinical allo-HCT mouse models.
