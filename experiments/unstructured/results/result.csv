1,238d990edb06f14a66463181ef08af24,"Disruption of intestinal microbial communities appears to underlie many human illnesses, but the mechanisms that promote this dysbiosis and its adverse consequences are poorly understood. In patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), we describe a high incidence of enterococcal expansion, which was associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and mortality. We found that Enterococcus also expands in the mouse gastrointestinal tract after allo-HCT and exacerbates disease severity in gnotobiotic models. Enterococcus growth is dependent on the disaccharide lactose, and dietary lactose depletion attenuates Enterococcus outgrowth and reduces the severity of GVHD in mice. Allo-HCT patients carrying lactose-nonabsorber genotypes showed compromised clearance of postantibiotic Enterococcus domination. We report lactose as a common nutrient that drives expansion of a commensal bacterium that exacerbates an intestinal and systemic inflammatory disease.

community of mostly anaerobic bacteria, and a hallmark of microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) observed in many disease states involves the expansion of facul- tative anaerobic bacteria (1). Enterococci are facultative anaerobes that colonize the intes- tines of almost every species, from insects to mammals (2), and make up a very small proportion (<0.1%) of the gut microbiota in healthy humans (3). However, enterococci are also pathogens; the species Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis are impor- tant causes of multidrug-resistant infections in patients (4). In single-center studies, E. faecium has been observed to dominate the fecal microbiota of immunocompromised patients after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), a curative-intent therapy for hematological malignancies (5–7). Moreover, fecal domination with vancomycin- resistant enterococci increases the risk of

Patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allo-HCT have poor outcomes with only ~30% long-term survival (9). Gut microbiota perturbations caused by broad-spectrum antibiotics and a reduction in microbial diversity are associated with in- creased transplant-related mortality and lethal GVHD in humans and mice (10–13). Besides causing infections, experimental studies in gno- tobiotic mice have revealed that enterococci play an important role in colitis (14) by stimulat- ing antigen-presenting cells and CD4+RORg+ T cell infiltration, causing intestinal inflam- mation (15). In this study, we investigated the role of enterococci in the development of acute GVHD, both in allo-HCT patients and preclinical allo-HCT mouse models.

We defined Enterococcus domination as relative genus abundance ≥0.3 (≥30%) in any fecal sample, following a thresh- old we have used previously (5) (materials and methods and fig. S2C). The incidence of domination rose comparably across cen- ters, with up to 65% of patients exhibiting a domination event after allo-HCT (Fig. 1A).

To further investigate these clinical obser- vations, we examined the fecal microbiota of mice early after transplantation using well- established mouse models of allo-HCT. In a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)– matched, minor-antigen-mismatched allo-HCT model [C57BL/6-to-129S1/Sv transplant (C57BL/ 6→129S1/Sv)], we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples and found that E. faecalis dominated the fecal microbiota at posttransplant day +8 in mice who re- ceived T cell–replete grafts and developed lethal, acute GVHD (Fig. 2A and fig. S4A). In contrast to the patients who had pro- longed antibiotic exposures, this expansion of E. faecalis was independent of antibiotic administration and dependent upon GVHD, as it was not observed in control recipients of T cell–depleted allografts in which GVHD did

The expansion of enterococci in murine allo- HCT recipients with GVHD was accompanied by an increase in Enterococcus colony–forming units recovered from mesenteric lymph nodes, consistent with increased bacterial translo- cation (Fig. 2B).

Although we observed E. faecium domina- tion in patients and a transient expansion of E. faecalis in GVHD mice, we hypothesized that both members of this genus might be associated with GVHD. Of note, E. faecium

We colonized germ-free C57BL/6 mice with a com- munity of six bacterial strains (Akkermansia muciniphila, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Blautia producta, Bacteroides sartorii, Clostridium bolteae, and Parabacteroides diastonis; see materials and methods) (10, 18, 19) 21 days prior to allo-HCT (LP/J→gnotobiotic C57BL/6).

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) coating of intestinal bacteria can be protective in colitis and is important for maintaining mucosal integrity (20). How- ever, we did not observe members of the genus Enterococcus to be enriched in either IgA- negative or IgA-positive fecal fractions, even though total fecal IgA was significantly re- duced in allo-HCT recipients with GVHD (fig. S5, B to D). Reduction of IgA by transplant- ing IgA-deficient bone marrow (BM) from activation-induced cytidine deaminase knock- out mice did not further increase enterococcal expansion (fig. S5E). Intestinal antimicrobial peptides of the Reg3 family can suppress the growth of VRE (21) and are reported to play a major role in GVHD (22). Accordingly, we found that both Reg3B/G transcripts and interleukin-22 protein, which regulates Reg3 expression (23), were reduced in the ileum of GVHD mice (fig. S5F).

Pre- and posttransplant fecal samples from MSKCC patients who received allo-HCT for acute myeloid leukemia were selected for sequencing on the basis of having a highly diverse pre-HCT microbiota and posttrans- plant E. faecium domination (by 16S rRNA gene sequencing). We focused on microbial metabolic pathways that specifically charac- terize domination by comparing them with the highly diverse pretransplant microbiota from the same patients. Pathways involved in DNA synthesis and, notably, in lactose and galactose degradation were enriched in the E. faecium–dominated, posttransplant micro- biota. In contrast, amino acid synthesis and starch-degradation pathways were more prev- alent in pretransplant specimens (Fig. 3A).

Duodenal lactase transcript abundance pro- gressively declined in BM+T recipients over the course of transplantation (fig.

or T/T alleles) and malabsorption (C/C alleles) in the upper gut (29). Although abundance of the genus Enterococcus increased comparably during exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics in both lactose absorbers and malabsorbers, enterococcal domination was significantly prolonged in malabsorbers after cessation of antibiotics (Fig. 4D and fig. S10). This finding suggests that the maintenance of enterococ- cal domination and microbiota recovery after broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure is signif- icantly modulated by the luminal availability of lactose as a growth substrate.

In gnotobiotic mouse models, enterococci exacerbate GVHD, consistent with previous reports of aggravated colitis in models of in- flammatory bowel disease (14) or systemic autoimmune responses (31).
